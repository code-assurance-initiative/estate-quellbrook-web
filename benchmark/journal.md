# Authoring journal — estate-quellbrook-web

## 2026-10-07 — answer key v1.0.0 draft written (key first)

- Part of Phase 4, the reference estate of the fictional carrier Quellbrook Freight (five repositories: gateway, web,
  orders, dispatch, notifier). The estate is designed as a whole first — services, HTTP and message contracts, teams,
  the three-sprint calendar and the story each repository's history tells — and this key is written from that design,
  before any code.
- The key is at integration level: the defects planted at their final sites, the traps a realistic service of this
  kind naturally contains, principled not-applicable entries and score bands set from intent. `clean` entries for
  every tracked file will be generated from `git ls-files` once the tree exists (files without a label: `"*"`).
- Planned line numbers are approximate and will be set to the final code (journalled) before the first scan.
- History plan (as in bench-csharp-maturity-history): the scripted sprint history is appended on top of this
  key-first commit, so the key precedes every line of code in the commit graph; the scripted commits carry fictional
  authors and dates in 2026-07..2026-09, earlier than this commit's real date. Nothing is force-pushed.
- Validated with `python3 -m cai_bench validate`: OK.
